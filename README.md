# topins

The idea of this project is to provide an accessible introduction to topological insualtors.
So far the project consists of

- notes on topological insualtors titled [A Primer on Topological Insualtors](https://github.com/shtsoft/topins/releases/latest/download/paper.pdf) which if you like you can cite as [.bib-file](https://github.com/shtsoft/topins/releases/latest/download/paper.bib)
- an [implementation of the Kane-Mele model](code/kmm.m) in matlab/octave

## Contributing

If you are dissatisfied with anything or have improvements, ideas or whatever feel free to make a pull request.
We are glad about any kind of help.

## TODO

A project is rarely perfect.
This one is not an exception and so some things remain to do:

- paper
  - more intuition and details on:
    - geometrical aspect of K-theory
    - Kane-Mele-Hamiltonian 
    - Kane-Mele-invariant-formula
  - perhaps add a subsection on Chern classes
- code
  - [it](code/kmm.m) is a hack (for various reason) and can certainly benefit from a rework
